PWNAT(1)     proxy server that works behind client+server NATs      PWNAT(1)

NAME
       pwnat - proxy server that works behind both client and server NATs

SYNOPSIS
        ./pwnat <-s | -c> <args>

DESCRIPTION
       There  is no middle man, no proxy, no 3rd party, no UPnP required, no
       spoofing, or DNS tricks.  The  server  does  not  need  to  know  the
       client's  IP address before connecting.  More importantly, the client
       can then connect to any host or port on any remote host or to a fixed
       host and port decided by the server.

OPTIONS
       -c     client  mode:  <args>:  [local  ip]  <local port> <proxy host>
              [proxy port (def:2222)] <remote host> <remote port>

       -s     server mode: <args>: [local ip] [proxy port (def:2222)]  [[al‐
              lowed host]:[allowed port] ...]

       -6     use IPv6

       -v     show debug output (up to 2)

       -h     show this help and exit

EXAMPLES
       1.  Server side allowing anyone to proxy: pwnat -s

       2.  Client  wanting  to  connect to google.com:80: pwnat -c 8000 <pw‐
           nat.server.com> google.com 80

       3.  browse to visit the google: http://localhost:8000
